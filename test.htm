  <div align="left"><font class="text"> On May 1, 2004 the European Union will 
    expand beyond its current "core Europe" constellation to include, for the 
    first time, nations of the former Eastern and Non-Aligned Blocks. For these 
    ten nations the 'day of accession' is the opportunity to rejoin a European 
    sphere which, for many, was felt to have been robbed through the militarily 
    enforced alliances of the Cold War.<br>
    <br>
    By recalling the pan-European Picnic of 1989 along the Austrian-Hungarian 
    border, which induced the events leading to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, 
    the Trans-European Picnic will mark the resultant shift in Europe's geopolitical 
    structure. For many however, the 'opening' brought about by the events of 
    1989 are now to be met by 'managed closure', restricted mobility, the revival 
    of 'visa regimes' delineating new barriers and borders as well as the imposition 
    of new top-down regulations, bureaucracies and standards. <br>
    <br>
    Through a two-day electronic media arts and culture gathering at the city 
    of Novi Sad, Serbia, a few kilometres beyond the European Union's new transnational 
    edge, the Picnic will bring together artists, theoreticians and media practitioners 
    from across Europe to explore the changing cultural and artistic landscape 
    within and beyond this new conglomerate of competing cultures, economies and 
    identities. The Trans-European Picnic will provide a lively platform of debate 
    and exchange into the evolving sense of identity and new forms of collaboration 
    active in countering the growing gap separating the Europe of the "Out-side" 
    from the Europe of the "In-side".<br>

A room was bathed in a deep blue neon light. A number of sofas were laid out to face the sun. The three of them were sitting with the music on, relaxing and basking the sunshine. The whole picture had the transparency of overexposure, or lucidity that puts you at ease and makes it hard to concentrate on something. Art is forcing them to explore things beyond their realm of imagination and makes them question reality.<br>
<br>
Jorjika (George Jorjoliani) is a musician. All that started back in the early 90's when he went to Germany, then traveled to Russia where he had his first studio, started socializing, meeting creative people, thinking collectively and making his first steps in music. Upon arrival in Georgia he started DJing in clubs. He played at club "Lift", where the three of them Gio, Levaniko and Jorjika all met. Jorjika's music is electronic, though he does not define is as such, rather his music is a reflection of the environment he communicates in, and the genre is determined by the people he interacts with. More than anything else, his music is associated with the energy, information and emotions that he accumulates during the day. Being a "slow net" he says slowly "I live in music and I realize myself through music". Though being involved social activities, he cannot do without his devotion. Whichever process happens internally, music is always the outcome. For him, music is a sound; and the cognition of this pushed him to start experimenting with sounds: from cognition to electronic music. As his friends Gio and Levaniko, he remains in close relation with visual culture as well by experimenting with a variety of visual media. As a 
musician and professional DJ he spends his time traveling, observing the transformation of human beasts from artificial Soviet structure into free and creative human beings.<br>
<br>
Here's where Gio (George Sumbadze) comes in wondering where to begin. He is a painter. "Semi- mechanic painter" as he says but "i forgot about being one". What he does is art. For him everything is art, regardless of the media, be it sound, light, installation, photography or video. However, despite his emphasis on ideas, he is more a conceptual artist because his work depends on elements over which he has little control. For example, he observes how people manage their identity in relation to social contextual information; how audio codes (such as commercials, politics etc) influence the energy flow in society. His current interests consider human-machine relationships, consciousness exploration through external technological means. Some of his recent ideas are to use sensors to sense a crowd's energy and, have audio respond to that; and design a robotic creature with behavioral and interactive qualities and observe how people relate to an organic but not anthropomorphic entity. Gio usually leaves music on a loop and listens to it all night and day, so that his dream world and daily activities coincide. "Any raw energy can be cultivated in you. It is an art to cultivate this energy and produce it", he says. Today, he just follows the flow while creating something and looks at the result tomorrow, so he can know for sure where he was yesterday.<br>
<br>
Levaniko (Levan Nutsubidze) rushed into the Georgian Pop TV channel with his innovative ideas to make it all meaningful and watch-worthy. Currently he is having a show called "Short cut", where he makes every effort to deliver good audio and video to the consumer market. He uses various forms of artistic expression: a combination of image, space body with electronic media, that can be defined as inter-media art. He examines the relationship between visual art and popular culture: how do artists respond to social, political and cultural events, how is art influenced by social norms, mass media, industrial technology and popular culture? Currently Levaniko is filming videos, photographing and making accessories by recycling different objects. He deconstructs factory-made consumer goods, cannibalizes and recycles them in either art objects or accessories. He intuitively chooses both his initial material and resultant object. <br>

Meeting and workshops of Free Media Initiatives on framing diverse strategies for sustainable cultural cooperation and exchange.<br><br>

Prague (CZ) 10-11th June, and Freistadt (A) 12-13th June<br><br>
<a href="http://www.fmedia.ecn.cz" target="_blank" class="link">http://www.fmedia.ecn.cz</a>
<br><br> 
The FM@dia Forum 04 in Prague and Freistadt will encourage a wide range of free media and community projects to discuss potential common strategies and shared interests (eg. Media policy), to improve mutual awareness, sharing know-how and content exchange.<br><br>

The rapid social, political, economical and technological shift of terms of the expanded "United Europe" pose a challenge to discuss, reframe and compare such topics as "free speech", "public access", "independence - media ownership", "creative commons", "digital gap" or "content exchange". All this and more requires a cross- referencing for establishing a common base and functioning platform for better collaboration among media activists, artists, free radios , 'zine publishers, internet publishers etc.<br><br>

While the region is characterised by a relatively high potential of growth of media and civic activities, the inter-connectivity reaching beyond the borders remains by comparison rare. Easier access to new digital technologies open new chances as well as threats for civic and community media as opposed to mass media and corporate structures. Activating and intensifying mutual communication and collaboration between different regions, languages and cultures is the aim of the "FM@dia" forum.<br><br>
    FM@dia FORUM 04: Connecting Free Media is organised by <strong>Radio Jeleni</strong>,<strong> 
    Econnect</strong> (Cz), <strong>European Civic Forum</strong>,<strong> VFRÖ</strong> 
    - Federation of Austrian Free Radios, <strong>Radio FRO</strong> (At), <strong>Radio

    <font class="text"><strong>The Lost Expedition</strong> is an experimental 
    project whose aim is to explore and mediate crucial cultural, technological 
    and environmental issues, by means of a rotating group of people from diverse 
    fields such as science, art, technology, social activism etc. The vehicle 
    of this effort is primarily a mobile workspace, which provides technical equipment 
    and living quarters for the participants. This roving laboratory employs advanced 
    communications technologies for gathering and transmitting data from innovative 
    and unusual research. The project is especially concerned with mediating seemingly 
    ambiguous, marginal or superfluous ideas/facts/events/knowledge/patterns. 
    <br>
    <br>
The Lost Expedition's goal is to detect, collect, archive, link, contextualize, emit and channel these patterns into the existing discourse as well as to initiate new discourse.  L.E. presumes a broad interpretation of the term "networking", and serves as a transient model for civic dialogue, addressing questions of liberty, human rights, mobility, ecology, communication, and of humanistic approaches to technology and science. In this respect L.E. is a symbol of a mental seed-data bank, a motorized Ark.  L.E. is interested distinctly in creating a multi-layered communication field, bringing the personal and public, banal and anomalous into the same framework. It can also facilitate the creation of new contacts between a variety of geographical and cultural niches, particularly those who are affected by the standardizing and homogenizing effects of globalization. It will trace the evolving mental and physical landscape principally within the geographical area of Eastern and Western Europe in the period from 2004, via the itinerant mobile lab, the MLOK Vehicle (The Multifunctional Loco-motivated Oblivion Kit Vehicle).
<br><br>
The project is organized by The Lost Expedition Brother/Sisterhood, an open transnational, non-profit body consisting of artists, social activists, journalists, scientists, and other researchers, and a group of individuals who are responsible for constructing, maintaining and operating the content and the technology.

Some weeks after the EU-enlargement in mid 2004, B04--BORDER 04 will shift the focus to the folds and fringes, the margins and new borders of the official Europe.
<br><br>
    <strong>B04</strong> is the common framework for a wide range of local and 
    remote, mobile and stationary activities taking place in summer 2004. It is 
    a modular, temporary, and tactical association of various new media and network 
    initiatives from East and West Europe, from outside as well as within the 
    new Europe. In order to explore the constitutive power of an emerging political 
    culture of networking, an international and interdisciplinary coalition of 
    fine art and performance artists, human rights and new media activists, filmmakers, 
    video- and fotografers, researchers, scientists and investigators will set 
    a series of events in motion that surround, circumvent and perforate the borders 
    of Europe. <br>
    <br>
B04 is a two month, virtual travel along both sides of the new, outer borders of an enlarged European Union, starting in Riga and moving around Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Slovenia to Zagreb.
<br><br>
The project seeks to review and research practices of networking that are already redefining the political geography of Europe. In the ongoing diversification of the social, processes of integration can no longer be clearly separated from mechanisms of exclusion. The working out of these tensions at a political and economic level is producing new levels of complexity as well as new opportunities for creative and experimental projects that challenge orthodoxy and convention. B04 will connect and shortcircuit debates around migration with debates about the expansion of the borders of the EU, around mobility, mobile technologies and freedom of movement, about the already within Europe and those previously outside it.
<ol type="1">
      <li><strong>Tracing the routes of migration</strong><br>
The many faces of migration are producing dramatic changes, that are not only affecting local and remote economies. People in transit, commuters between East and West, seasonal and domestic workers form new concepts of Europe, that are based on mobility, no matter if unsolicited or unvoluntarily.
</li><br><br>
      <li><strong>Mapping the spaces in between</strong><br>
Theoretically it's only a small drift from what lies beyond the limitations of national imagination to the imaginations of those outside of it. But in practice, the spaces between Europe and non-Europe are being dispersed, extracted and contracted by numerous movements of very different actors on an unknown and ever-changing field.
</li><br><br>
      <li><strong>Crossing the borders from the real to a virtual europe</strong><br>
Leaving traditional political and geographical notions of Europe behind the information and communication technologies as well as the flows of migration do shape a virtual europe, that is defined by it's openness rather than it's borders. There is an unrepresentable multitude of europes to be discovered and explored.
</li>
</ol>
Working on these three fields of interest B04 will consist of four modules that will be developed by independent organizing teams, that are networking among each others:
<br><br>
    <strong>RESEARCH</strong><br><br>
In order to investigate the subjectivities of a new generation of europeans and the constitutive power of young people networking across borders, research units will work on frequently asked questions: How does a re-designed european border regime change the daily life of the people in the areas of the new border regions? Which stories, experiences and what desires do people have, that live on this and that side of the new border of the official, but in the midst of a virtual Europe? What does living conditions of people that are on the move look like? On the move into illegality or into precarious labour or into detention centers? How do workers of the worldmarket factories struggle and organise -- in- and outside of the new external european border?
<br><br>
<strong>WORKSHOPS</strong><br><br>
B04 will involve leading international artists and local community organisers in workshops and training programs in both an adhoc and a sustainable fashion adressing the needs of local activists and civil society. It will focus on skill-sharing to enable and empower young people with the practical use of new media technologies by providing connectivity, introducing open source software and offering unfettered access to communication tools. There will be a special focus on the potential of digital media to facilitate dialogue and communication across national borders, and on the power of filmmaking, photography and storytelling in the negotiation of emerging, hyphenated identities.
<br><br>
<strong>PERFORMANCES</strong><br><br>
In order to present the images and narratives of an emerging european culture that is currently created around the issues of information society and transnational mobility, B04 will present exhibitions, screenings and performances in public spaces and in close collaboration with local and international artists and art institutions.
<br><br>
    <strong>DOCUMENTATION</strong><br><br>
In order to document the experiences, acquaintances, results and achievements of the project publically, in real-time or near on real-time internet connectivity is one of the key issues. B04 will be accompanied by a specially equipped van that provides a high-bandwith internet connection via satellite. Using all available media from print to radio to video in different output-formats the real-time documentation of a project at such an extend aims to facilitate dialogue and interactive communication between Europe's diverse peoples, new and old. The ultimate goal is to build a  new vision of Europe that moves on against exclusion, resentment, localism, narrow-mindednesss, racism and xenophobia.
<br><br>
Currently the B04 developer team is in touch and discussing the concept with a multitude of institutions, fundations, media centers and local initiatives from all over Europe:

    <font class="text"> <strong>maf_media art farm</strong> (former name: Caucasian 
    Center for Cultural Development, CCCD) was established in April 2000 as an 
    independent Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) that supports the development 
    of contemporary visual culture in the Caucasus. maf intends to develop and 
    promote a multi-cultural dialogue in the Caucasus and to focus on acute social 
    and political questions by undertaking visual research. maf provides links 
    to four spheres: education, information, network and innovation. <br>
    <br>
In September 2001 maf launched the Caucasian Institute of Photography and New Media (the maf_Institute) in order to promote the education in the field of contemporary arts in the Caucasus. At the moment 22 students are enrolled in the faculty of photography, a four-year educational programme licensed by the Ministry of Education of Georgia. At present the maf_Library containing more than 3500 volumes represents the first large collection of publications on contemporary art, photography, new media, architecture and design in the region of the Caucasus. The maf_Library is open to all interested persons who want to become library member.
<br><br>
By organising interdisciplinary projects as well as by providing adequate infrastructure maf is establishing a platform for contemporary culture in the Caucasus. The platform creates an environment where artists can meet and present their work within an international network. At the same time it hosts outstanding Caucasian and foreign artists and their exhibitions. In October 2001 maf started the project called "appendix", which takes place in Tbilisi every second year, and researches the position of the South-Caucasian countries in nowaday's world through the eyes of artists from both inside and outside of the Caucasus.
<br><br>
maf aims to promote contemporary art and new media forms as a possible way of communication, reflection and cooperation. The maf_Box, a new media lab, was established to provide conceptual and technical facilities to students, artists as well as NGO's dealing with current social, political and cultural issues.

    <strong>State of Sabotage</strong>
    <br>
First initiated as a project by artist Robert Jelinek in 1992, in operation as an international music/art label, collective and organization since 1994, Sabotage has now, in 2003, drawn its own artistic conclusions and declared itself a state - a state in time, with constantly expanding citizens' territories, but without the demarcation of national own an SoS passport and enjoy the status of an SoS citizen. SoS is a physically vital collective body, installed in real everyday social and political space. It is a growing organism whose dynamics, spirit and diversity are shaped by the citizens themselves.

The project [Sensor Diet] consists of two parts: an audio part, which is compiled of two components (analog/digital output), and a visual part. The analog audio part offers a performance with turntables, spinning records from the Soviet times. The latter are: Georgian and Russian fairy-tales, narrated by different voices and articulations, and various language courses for the Georgian population, containing all the conventional language-session elements.
<br><br>
The digital audio part will be executed from different electronic devices: MD player; laptop, etc. alongside with the analog performance, and presents Georgian telecom operator network speeches mixed with the shifting frequency noises.
<br><br>
The visual part elaborates on the aforementioned audio output, by overlapping two systematic and periodical frameworks in terms of motion and gestures. The video is a double edit of the news program vijaysfrom Soviet period television, and current television in Georgia. The image thus presents two layers simultanously.

Anabala will base their Novi Sad performance 'Transistan' on their experiences acquired through living in Istanbul. Founder members Murat Ertel and Ceren Oykut live at the Asian part (Anatolian side) of Istanbul and travel through European side almost everyday. They travel 70 km. per day at least breaking the symbolic, geographical, and sociological borders of these two controvert ional continents.
<br><br>
Ertel, mostly a musician and Oykut,mostly a painter transfer their artistic concentration onto each others. They create multi-disciplinary pieces by taking the aspects of humour, parody and surprise as the basic elements of their performances.

Anababala also performed for the exhibition "Walking Istanbul, Notes from the Quarantine" in The Digital Lab, Holon, Tel-Aviv. (2003-2004) <br>

The video is a sort of documentary, wherein all interviewed people are asked whether they know anything about Polish art. In addition they are also questioned whether they have any knowledge about particular incidents related to censoring art in Poland within the past years. After a while one realises that the people answering the questions are not really familiar with the subject, and just repeat clichés. At the end of the video it is almost certain that the viewer ends up knowing much less about Polish art than before.

    <font class="text">
	<br>
    Joost Conijn (NL), 2002, <strong>31' </strong><br>
    <br>
    
In the summer of 2001 Joost Conijn built a car. The car is made out of wood, and runs on wood as well, using wood as fuel instead of petrol. With this wood car Conijn undertakes a journey through several countries in Eastern Europe: Romania, Ukraine, Albania. Independent from petrol, he leaves conventional roads behind him. There is no preset destination. The artist travels towards the unknown, the camera covers it all. The main plan is to make a film about the unexpected the wood car will engender. In order to keep the motor running, Conijn travels through woods. Across little villages, people guide him to local saw-mills and offer him some food and spare wood. The car serves as an artless intermediary.
<br><br>
Starting point for the work of Joost Conijn is the artist's fascination for other worlds, alternative ways of life just outside the accommodated environment. Travelling is to him like an uncontainable urge, just like his need for adventure. Every journey unravels an accumulation of unforeseen events and ingenuous exchange. "Wood car" stems from Conijn's desire to move and transport himself independently and open-mindedly, questioning cultural presumptions connected to dominant frameworks in western society. His former films "Car on roof "(1996), "C'est une hek" (1997) and "Airplane" (2000) mainly focus on the vehicle: the mechanics and the notion of moving. Currently, his point of view is gradually shifting towards people and cultures close to life's basic conditions.
<br><br>
Similar to his working process, the film's imagery is simple, natural, poetic, anachronistic yet attentive. His drive is unbeatable: living intensely, giving it all.

Anabala is multidisciplinary project concentrating on Istanbul's sounds and cult. The project consist of two artists: Murat Ertel, mostly a musician and Ceren Oykut, mostly a painter transfer their artistic concentration onto each others. They create multi-disciplinary pieces by taking the aspects of humour, parody and surprise as the basic elements of their performances.
<br><br>
Anabala took its name from a passage at central Istanbul where two founder members rented an empty shop for 30 dollars for a month. They tried to form a fake shop only using the material which were leftovers (or ruins) from the previous shop, which was a tattoo shop. During this one month period they recorded the voices they heard and have made at the shop during the day and mixed them by night. At the end all those mixes formed the first album. One song out of it made it to the sound art compilation album called "ctrl-alt-del" as an outcome of an joint project on sound art developed both in Istanbul and Maastricht. (2003) Anababala also performed for the exhibition "Walking Istanbul, Notes from the Quarantine" in The Digital Lab, Holon, Tel-Aviv. (2003-2004). 
Anabala has stared collaboration with musicians, sound-artists and visual artists from Köln, Germany and formed another group called K34 -Köln-Istanbul Cultural Exchange Project.

<strong><strong>"Four Images"</strong></strong>, Hatice Güleryüz, 2004 (22')<br>
<br>
Hatice Güleryüz' films orbit around the mental states of  suppressing social situations. She associates and reflects on these mental states with hard-hitting physical conditions. She describes Four Images as "A film about a suggestion of a memory-image, or the representation of  fragmentary moments of recollection that happen in the mind".
<br><br>
    <ul><strong>Hatice Güleryüz</strong> studied fine arts in Turkey, attended artist-in-residence 
    programmes in Berlin, Munich, and London. She obtained her MFA from the Hogeschool 
    voor de Kunsten Arnhem (NL), and from the Willem de Kooning Academie, Rotterdam 
    (NL). From 2002-2003 Hatice ws a reseracher at the Fine Arts Department of 
    the Jan van Eyck Academie, Maastricht (NL).</ul> <br>
    <br>
<strong>"No (or bad signal)"</strong>, Ali Demirel, 1998- 2004 (2')
<br><br>
No (or bad signal) shows a state of mobility fused into the transmitting confusion of broadcasting technology, and operation logic. 
<br><br>
    <ul><strong>Ali Demirel</strong> studied Architecture and Audio-Visual Media at 
    Middle-East Technical University. He is an independent video artist with a 
    serious experimental edge. Instead of using video images to create a narrative, 
    he uses loop-based found or shot images, to reach a sensory stimulation which

    gathering in corners and behaving like a herd with no organization. The video 
    track is paired with a soundtrack directly referring to the realm of computer 
    arcade games, where the player is kept always on the run to proceed throughout 
    the game. The name of the work involves black humour, which is incorporated 
    throughout the work. <br>

<strong>"Fox Dance"</strong>, Babazula, 2003 (1')
<br><br>
Fox Dance is a video clip created as a stop-motion animation. The piece is based on our relationship with life through objects and ideas in motion.
<br><br>
    <ul><strong>BabaZula</strong> is a music group, founded in 1996 by Levent Akman 
    (percussion, rhythm machines, toys), Murat Ertel (saz and other strings,vocal) 
    and Emre Onel (darbuka, sampler, vocal) in Istanbul. In 2003 they were joined 
    by Oya Erkaya (bass guitar,vocal). BabaZula's music is basically an amalgamation 
    of recorded natural sounds with both traditional and modern acoustic and electronic 
    musical instruments: a culmination of disparate electronic effects. Starting 
    out with improvisations, later fixed into musical elements which make up their 
    music such as theme, tune, style and sound, reached through recordings and 
    rehearsals, the group has carried their method of "defined improvisation" 
    into concerts, movies, and theatrical plays. The use of video, slides and 
    films in their live performances, is prepared by additional members, who have 
    joined forces with the core group. BabaZula's debut album, " Tabutta Rovasata 
    (Somersault in the Coffin)", including the original soundtrack for Dervis 
    Zaim's first movie, was released in 1996. Their album, " 3 Oyundan 17 Müzik" 
    was released in 1999. BabaZula made the soundtrack of the film " Renkli Türkçe 
    (Colored and in Turkish)". They performed in Efes Pilsen Festival and Mediteranneen 
    Film Festival, and also had big scale concerts such as "Printemps de Bourges". 
    Their latest album "Psychobelly Dance Professor) was released in May 2003, 
    mastered by Mad Professor.</ul> <br>

    The presentation will give introduction to exStream project (<a href="http://www.ex-stream.net" class="link" target="_blank">www.ex-stream.net</a>) 
    - a two-year collaborative project supported by Culture 2000 Programme of 
    European Union, in which five media art organisations: <strong>Hull Time Based 
    Arts</strong> (Hull, UK); <strong>V2_</strong> (Rotterdam, NL); <strong>Bootlab</strong> 
    (Berlin, DE);<strong> interSpace Media Art Center</strong> (Sofia, BG); <strong>t0

    and technological resources to create a common platform for the creation and 
    distribution of new media art projects. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>ExStream</strong> network and activities will be presented from the 
    perspective of the only South East European partner in the project - InterSpace

    <font class="text"> <br>
    Pavel Braila (MD), 2002, film shot on DV transferred to DVD (<strong>26'</strong>)<br>
    <strong><br>
    "Shoes for Europe"</strong> probes a politically enforced East-West-differentiation 
    - against the backdrop of historical transition - as inscribed into the everyday 
    experience of traveling and commuting. In the small frontier train station 
    of Ungheni at the Moldavian-Romanian border, every train stops for three hours 
    and is lifted two meters in the air to change wheels from Russian Gauge used 
    in Moldova to Standard Gauge used in Romania and Western Europe. The trains' 
    laborious passage between East and West (which is illegally recorded by the 
    artist since no shooting is officially allowed in the Moldavian border area) 
    hosts a double fantasy structure of an ever growing desire to gain access 
    to Western Europe, with the prevailing notion demanding the homogenization 
    of communicative and technological tools to neutralize distance and place. 
    Shot in digital video, two images are projected mirroring the ever-present 
    subject of how to locate and mediate subjectivity in times of fragmentation, 
    dislocation and a new myth of transnational identity. <br>

The name Belgradeyard Sound System refers to the 2-hour weekly radio show broadcasted at Radio B 92 (Wednesdays, 00-02 AM), the authors being Goran Simonoski and Relja Bobic. After three years of their active presence on the local music and cultural scene, the first idea of presenting non-commercial, contemporary production of all music genres is clearly seen in all events bearing this mark. Original musical productions under the same name are being released by the British label Cosmic.Sounds, as well as the German Klangkrieg and the Slovenian rx:tx. Until the end of 2004, a full-length debut by this project will also see the light of day. In order to promote this material in a live context, the band of the same name has been formed, with the founding memebrs on programming and additon of the double-bass player Ivan Antic. The band has already performed in London, Budapest, Berlin, Graz, Ljubljana... The most important project is the festival of electronic music Dis-patch held in Belgrade, which will countinue to present the current names of the global electronic scene to Yugolslav audience each October.

    <br>
    Sophia Basic born 1949 in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was educated as 
    therapist in abnormal psychology and developmental disabilities, at the University 
    of Belgrade. She didn't work in her professional field, except for some years 
    at a school. She worked in a restaurant in Mostar, named after Aleksa Shantic' 
    poem "Christmas Eve". This restaurant was destroyed, and burned, whereupon 
    she moved to Belgrade, and started a trade in kiosk on Bulevar kralja Aleksandra 
    street. Her kiosk is of the type 9-standard, and she has been working in it 
    for seven years. In October 2003 the municipal authorities issues a "contest" 
    for the placement of a new type of kiosk at various locations in the city. 
    Not only did Sophia lose her kiosk location, but her bid to buy a new kiosk 
    was turned down in favor of other contestants. On November 27th 2003, she 
    locked herself - in protest - inside the kiosk. Her action runs 24/7, and 
    she hasn't left to this day. She loves poetry and singing; she is the mother 
    of two sons and daughter, and her 80-years old father still lives in Bosnia. 
    <br>

    <label class="subCaptionSmall">Statement</label>
    <br>
    <br>
    We have chosen this example to draw attention to how an individual subject's 
    agency can establish frames of standardization, which can surpass those established 
    on a local, as well as on a universal level. <br>
    <br>
    The question arises which sort of agency manifests itself in this particular 
    case. We can identify 6 different types of agency, working on 6 different 
    levels: </font> 
    <ul type="circle">
      <li><font class="text">tradition (private family business)</font></li>
      <li><font class="text">property (existing type of kiosk)</font></li>
      <li><font class="text">surrounding city structure (attempt to maintain a 
        location)</font></li>
      <li><font class="text">civil disobedience</font></li>
      <li><font class="text">resistance to local standardization</font></li>
      <li><font class="text">resistance to standardization in general</font></li>
    </ul>
    <font class="text"> Sophia Basic's story points to various aspects of inhumane 
    treatment: the communal service staff is offensive towards her; during winter 
    many expected her to give up her struggle, and succumb to cold, hunger, dirt, 
    or simply the obvious pointlessness of her action. Authorities surveyed, and 
    are actually still surveying her from afar. They check whether she remains 
    inside the kiosk during the night, or whether she leaves in order to get some 
    warmth and sleep, away from the cardboard and plastic floor of the kiosk. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The mass media are not very interested in her case, or in her origins, which 
    are an amalgam of deplorable circumstances, namely the destiny of refugee 
    from Mostar, Bosnia. The fact that nowadays there are a multitude of donations 
    and funds - promising even to repair Mostar bridge - will not alter her experience 
    of war, escape and destruction, that so many others share with her. We seem 
    to digress, but this second chapter of difficulties in her life is very similar 
    to the first: she finds herself yet again under fatal social pressure. <br>
    <br>
    Sophia Basic is only an example which clearly illustrates that even a mere 
    change in the system by the implementation of a different set of standards, 
    can abolish tendencies which at first sight seem in accord with that very 
    system, such as maintaining a small private business. <br>
    <br>
    The abandonment of Sophia's economic model favors local standardization - 
    not necessarily conform to EU models - above individual subsistence. <br>
    <br>
    However, the form of her resistance and rebellion remind us that we should 
    approach matters of standardization in local communities with an open mind. 
    Issues such as human rights, humanity and empathy towards special cases, are 
    to be taken into account. The current situation in Serbia leaves governmental 
    authorities in a standardization quagmire, while trying to navigate between 
    the old communist structures, new structures, and policies coming from the 
    EU. No wonder that this state of confusion leads to a loss in value systems, 
    and a disregard for those victimized by the latter. <br>
    <br>
    The kiosk appears to be a transitional form of trade activity, and hence signifies 
    much more than just the turnover of goods in the streets. It is an improvised 
    business space, set aside from architectonically developed and codified edifices. 
    The potential of this strategy seems like a good solution in a region described 
    as the "Balkans elephant path", i.e. difficult, atavistic, dark, and enigmatic. 
    Nevertheless, in the backdrop of migrations, refugee problems, minimal incomes, 
    and gray economies, evacuated and displaced people try to live their "constant-temporary" 
    lives in proximity of standardization. </font> </div>

    <br>
In 2002, complying with an European Union ruling, Yugoslavian families (among them many Roma) who had fled their land to escape the war, were deported to Serbia and Montenegro after a stay of ten years in Western Europe. However, the newold homeland has meanwhile become strange to them. There is no money, work, living accommodation, and social contact. How is it possible to survive under these conditions? Zilniks critical documentary film accompanies the taxi driver Kenedi, who, day and night, brings these uprooted people from the airport to the illegal settlements on the outskirts of Belgrade.

      <strong>Zelimir Zilnik (SCG)</strong> <br>
      Zelimir Zilnik was born in Serbia, Yugoslavia, in 1942. His first film, 
      Rani Radovi (Early Works), was awarded the 'Golden Bear' at the Berlinale 
      international film festival of 1969. In Serbia, the works of this director 
      of the New Yugoslavian Cinema were officially banned. In 1973, he immigrated 
      to the Federal Republic of Germany, where his short films critically commented 
      on the situation of foreign workers, and on terrorism. He was therefore 
      expelled from the country in 1976, and returned to Yugoslavia. Since then, 
      Zilnik has worked as an independent documentary film-maker.

    interview with Brian Holmes<br>
    <br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: For the second time we are witnessing the phenomenon of enlargement and unification of the European Union. From one point of view, many people tend to equate the term 'empire' with the USA and its recent aggressive foreign policy strategies. Yet, European integration is conditioned by a strong enforcement of laws and legitimate rules, which have big influences on EU members or future member countries. According to the landscape this strategy is creating, would you say that the European Union presents a new form of 'soft' empire?</em>
</ul>
<strong>BH</strong>: Actually, when Negri and Hardt theorized Empire, I think what they were really talking about was the European Union! They thought that the cultural legitimacy, formal law, and constitutional guarantees that seemed so prominent during the Clinton years were going to continue to develop uninterruptedly as a model for kind of global constitutionalism. What happened instead was that America's old nationalist-imperialist right connected to the oil companies, to the major industries and above all to the army, came back and reasserted a classically imperialist paradigm. The European Union can't do that. In fact, what you read about constitutional dynamics in the book "Empire" describes a lot better the way the EU is operating, even if they just failed miserably with the first attempt at a constitution. Still the overall notion of empire has a meaning, which is not just reducible to imperialism. Globalization is articulated around three major regions. The first is the United States, which has firmly established NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), and is trying to extend that over the entire western hemisphere in the form of the FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas), which they probably won't succeed in finishing. Realistically, they are aiming to push all the way down through Central America to Colombia and Venezuela, which will result in an articulated production bloc, over which they would like to have a more or less unified kind of control. The European Union has succeeded in responding to this quite rapidly, promoting its own continental unification with a more social-democratic kind of management. Here the question of legitimacy is much more important than for the Americans, who just need to take control, turn on the TV stations and start enforcing the rules. There is a third area in the world, South East Asia, where there is a beginning of institutional construction called the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations). It's very unclear what's going to happen there because of the role of Japan, which is the major center of capital accumulation in that part of the world. It appears impossible for the Japanese to assert any kind of central organizing control, because of what they did in World War II, the naked force, the atrocities. So you have this very uncertain situation, where Japan supplies the capital, the Chinese and the rest of the ASEAN countries do the labor, and no one really knows what the future will be. Empire is the controlled disagreement and rivalry between these three very shaky ways of getting people to work together. There is a global market, and the Americans obviously have a global military, but there isn't one global production schema. There are rather three evolving forms of continental integration, each with its own periphery. This is the key thing-each with its own periphery! And that's where we can finally start talking about the constitutionalism of the European Union.
The EU constantly presents itself as an entirely legitimate sort of democratic, integrative thing, based on rights, cultures, languages, exchanges. It wants to present itself as a kind of utopia; but it too has its periphery. In fact, I would say there are two peripheries: an internal periphery, underneath the umbrella of the single currency, and this sort of gigantic free-trade bloc around it. The internal periphery is mainly the former East, where many of the countries are now becoming members of the EU. I'm sure we're going to see a transfer of low-waged jobs to the internal periphery of the EU, and the emergence of an increasing number of mechanisms to maintain the distinction between people living on the periphery and the people living on the center, i.e. Germany, Belgium, Holland, France, Italy and Spain. Of course, England is a kind of pivot for all this, it's the force that tries to draw the whole European construction over into the American bloc, while Germany and France constantly resist England's strategy, as everybody saw so clearly during the last Iraq war. For me, that's the big picture. We have to talk about all that, before we begin to talk about anything specific. Then we get to the question: "What's life like on these two European peripheries?"
<br><br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: Life on the peripheries has already changed. Ten former socialist countries from Central and Eastern Europe are joining the EU on May 1st. The question arises how this periphery, these Eastern countries, are going to fit in? Taking the obvious cultural differences into account: how can they accommodate Western standards? This paradigm shift led by the heritage of socialism-is it going to happen, or is it going to just stay like it is?
</em></ul>
    <strong>BH</strong>: I think this is a huge historical process. It's going to 
    continue, potentially over generations. The initial construction of the EU 
    involved a lot of attempts to harmonize territorially what was happening in 
    the member states. There are what they call structural funds, which were given 
    to Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland. Those countries were really the big winners 
    in the first enlargement of the EU, during the '70s and the '80s particularly. 
    Of course, this raised a lot of hopes for all the new entrants into the EU, 
    but what you see now is a bit different. There are nowhere near as much structural 
    funds available to achieve this kind of equalization and implementation of 
    a common standard of production and consumption that allowed the Spanish and 
    the Portuguese to reach the same level as their immediate neighbors, the French. 
    I don't think they're going to be able to achieve that with the new members, 
    because the EU has shifted from being a political project to become a free 
    trade bloc. The inner periphery is not joining the EU that it dreamt of in 
    the '70s and '80s. It's not a Vaclav Havel, literary sort of thing where they 
    build theaters and give everyone a fair trial. It's a production machine where 
    you're ultimately competing with the United States and some combination of 
    Japan and China. Now, if you go to the outer periphery, it becomes worse. 
    What is the interest of this space outside the border? From the capitalistic 
    point of view, the interest is that you can take advantage of weak labor laws, 
    you can take advantage of all kinds of zones where there are no rights, not 
    even the relatively meager rights which you're going to have inside the EU. 
    On the inner periphery, those rights will have to be more or less respected. 
    But outside, you can really have predatory capitalism. And what is there to 
    stop it? A historical project for an alternative to capitalism generated cultural 
    forms which are now rejected, because of, what did they call it? - "democratic 
    centralism." Basically, the Soviet-style bureaucracy was unbearable, insufferable, 
    and all those cultural and organizational forms have been rejected. Now the 
    countries on the outer periphery are going to be exposed to a very savage 
    form of predatory capitalism. So when you think about what you're going to 
    do over the next few years, just keep in mind that everywhere there's a need 
    for the reinvention of cultures of resistance. This need for cultures of resistance 
    is interesting for all of us, and at the same time very daunting for all of 
    us, very formidable as a challenge. Because everyone is faced with a similar 
    mix of situations. You can see the same thing on the edges of the American 
    bloc. When you live in Latin America, you can use some of the tools that are 
    coming from the center, but the conditions under which you live are much more 
    dramatic and savage. People are facing the danger of having no income, of 
    having no more functioning state to develop any kind of social welfare programs; 
    and in cultural terms, there is the danger of having no places sheltered from 
    the market. But this also means that people are forced to take risks, to invent 
    new structures, to develop new solidarities. The question then becomes: can 
    people trying to resist the capitalist process in the central areas find ways 
    to cooperate with people living on the peripheries, while recognizing the 
    differences and not just confidently exporting the beginnings of whatever 
    solution or ideology they are finding to areas where the conditions are not 
    at all the same? I think this would be a question to ask, the question of 
    solidarity. <br>
    <br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: We mentioned the first EU enlargement, which invested much more instructional reanimation in institutions, in terms of accommodating certain Western standards. Right now, it seems that the strategy of EU enlargement has changed.  Everything seems to be based on power, not on financial investments and structural funds. This approximates what actually exists in Western countries. Could this mean that we are experiencing a process of structuring an open-trade market and locating new labor resources?
</em></ul>
<strong>BH</strong>: At this point, globalization is everywhere a capitalist project, developing simultaneously on the regional and world scales. But this project is always expressed through local systems of governance and culture. In the situation on the external periphery of Europe, as in Serbia, what you are likely to see is a strong manipulation by people who want to create a local system of power, which will develop in parallel to a predatory capture of markets. Markets are very important to the central countries, much more so than labor which can increasingly be done by robots. If you want to get somewhere in the world, invent a consuming robot! In the case of Serbia, there will be a much smaller capture of some kind of labor force. That has happened on a larger scale in other peripheral countries, such as Hungary or the Czech Republic, where they're using what's considered a sophisticated and yet very cheap labor force, somewhat like what the Irish labor force was considered to be in the '70s and '80s. Poland is a third case, which is going to become increasingly important. The question for them is, are they going to be able to develop their education systems as Ireland did? Are they going to emerge from the position of being a cut-rate, unregulated cheap-labor zone? I'm afraid that's not even the question in countries like Serbia. Rather, it's about buying up certain kinds of resources, for instance tourist infrastructure, which is massively owned by Western interests now; so it's about invasively taking over markets. But there's not going to be any particular investment in the political and cultural system of the outer peripheries. The EU wants those countries to remain relatively stable, without too many civil wars-but they will accept anything that works. What we are likely to see, in the absence of any deep institution-building, is the attempt by the local political classes to create some kind of national identity, a folkloric identity, where cultural differences are maintained. And these differences are also maintained to give people a way to explain the tremendous difference between their situation and the situation of people living just on the other side of the border, like the capacity for mobility, for having a job and an education, which is dramatically different. So, if they explain to you that your identity is dramatically different, then this could be quite useful for a political class who wants to find the way to try to set up an enduring structure of governance. Unfortunately, all the things I've just described are also the perfect recipe for inter-ethnic wars, and if you look around, you'll see that those wars are becoming the way that imperial geopolitical management "works"...
So what about people who want to do experiments in media? And what if these are not only experiments in creativity and expressivity, but also in connectivity, in organization, in processes of what I would call micro-representation, where you find a way to network among small groups? All this is a very contemporary experiment in democracy. It's also a self-managed educational process. It also trains a sophisticated labor force. And it even opens up markets for consumer electronics, for media products, for lifestyles and all those things. So the small, independent initiatives are at the center of all the contradictions! For these good reasons you will get a lot of interest from the European civil societies and from the EU cultural funders, plus a much more ambivalent treatment from the local political class, for which you are at once a kind of promise and a kind of threat, simultaneously. The easy solution, of course, is to be the poster boys and girls for a cultural modernization that only happens in a few bureaucrats' dreams. Or to be the gadflies of a hometown techno-class that interfaces between the local power-brokers and the EU businesses. But neither of those solutions are really enough when you have to live under the constant shadows of fascism, civil war, international intervention, and the whole disaster show that goes along with capitalist globalization. So I guess the question of what used to be called "institution-building" gets somehow real again, but in a different way.
<br><br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: Those small, independent initiatives that you have mentioned don't necessarily need to stay small, with limited influence. When we talk about media and new communication technologies, there is always the question of infrastructure. The latter is a very interesting thing, especially in the Eastern part of Europe. Yet, an underdeveloped infrastructure is also a great opportunity for building up mainstream media monopolies. What is the future or are the possibilities for independent media initiatives in Europe and beyond? </em>
</ul>
    <strong>BH</strong>: There is always the question of the relationship between 
    alternative media and major media, which we don't talk about enough. If you 
    want to extend the kinds of experimental practices that you're interested 
    in, eventually you come to a point where it's a question of enlarging. That 
    means both enlarging the number of people who are collaborating with you, 
    and also your infrastructure-your space, equipment base, and the possibility 
    for people to work on full-time projects. And then you have to confront your 
    real situation in society. Lot of people became aware of this when Soros pulled 
    out of places like the former Yugoslavia. There had been a possibility to 
    develop in a kind of social vacuum, because people came from the US or Northern 
    Europe with all these ideals of legitimacy and the need for direct democratic 
    expression and access to media and so on, and they gave a sort of a "jump 
    start" to lots of initiatives. It wasn't really so different in the central 
    countries. We saw tremendous growth in these "democratic experiments," experiments 
    in representation and communication, which initially surfed on the stock-market 
    boom. They developed along paths of rhizomatic singularization, in a way that 
    was predicted surprisingly well by Guattari in late '80s and early '90s. But 
    how far can they go before they come up against the wall of capitalistic culture, 
    which is basically defined by the major media? How can we stave off the integration 
    of these new expressive and communicational possibilities into a system of 
    flexible production, consumption and management that's still beneath the boot 
    of those who control the major media? I think it's an unresolved question 
    all over the world. There hasn't been much penetration of the media, because 
    people don't want to. And they're right! But we do need infrastructure and 
    a lot more small institutions, which could manage things like festivals, but 
    with enough autonomy to actually produce access to more than just tools, access 
    to a whole kind of a culture of self-organization and co-operativity. So far, 
    what we have is a kind of a floating situation with temporary sorts of gatherings 
    and great amount of a volunteer work, which is very good. But maybe we need 
    to find how to expand the volunteer aspect, while creating certain kinds of 
    infrastructure or institutions that don't bureaucratize or commercialize, 
    and don't halt the kind of innovation that creates the desire on which everything 
    is founded. This would be a real development of constituent power, in its 
    divergence from all the constituted powers. I think that's the interesting 
    perspective. What Geert Lovink said at the Neuro festival was right: "Things 
    begin with an event." The event, in the mid and late '90s, was "networked 
    media becoming accessible." Then came political events: the anti-globalization 
    movement. And also institutional events: the invention of all these little 
    media centers. We are now living off those events, and the question is: "How 
    can we start to invent something that transforms a big surprise into sort 
    of possibility for many, many smaller ones-without taking away the possibility 
    of another big surprise?" <br>
    <br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: Now we come to this question of solidarity, which is present in every kind of process of cooperation, networking and working together. Could you elaborate on the parallel you draw between the movement of non-aligned countries that existed during '60s, and the present situation, where witness a growth of independent social and media movements world-wide.  
</em></ul>
    <strong>BH</strong>: I think it's something we could all really look out for. 
    In a text called "Imaginary Maps, Global Solidarities," I wrote about the 
    non-aligned movement, which was built up in the '60s, particularly around 
    India, Cuba, and the former Yugoslavia, and which was also an important reference 
    point for the political resistance movements and counter-cultures of the developed 
    countries. By evoking that, I just wanted to give a kind of historical analogy 
    to an unfulfilled possibility of today. I think there is nothing like that 
    right now, but I also think that something similar will be or already is a 
    necessity. In the emergence of a stronger cooperation between India, South 
    Africa and Brazil, there is a kind of direct echo of the non-aligned movement. 
    But I'm not sure it's enough. I don't think that we've yet seen an invention 
    in those terms. And I'm not sure that we've really seen an invention with 
    the "social forum movement" either, because there's a lot of nostalgia for 
    the non-aligned movement, and for modernist central planning. The ones who 
    have that nostalgia tend to be the better-organized ones, because they're 
    still inhabiting the organizations that came out of that period. But the problem 
    is that they don't face the failures of the modernizing projects. That is 
    a certain limit on the amount of people who can be integrated into those projects, 
    leaving behind the massive reality of those who are excluded. You can see 
    it very clearly in countries like Argentina. It was a modernizing society, 
    an industrial system with European-style social guarantees, including health 
    care, public education, retirement benefits and so on. What happened is that 
    the capitalist project we were talking about before just destroyed that modernizing 
    attempt, in a process that goes from the dictatorship in Argentina in 1976-83 
    all the way to the Menem period in the '90s, when public services were massively 
    sold off, according to the plan of the IMF but to the direct profit of the 
    local political class. That political class became tremendously rich, along 
    with the local business class. At the same time, literally half the population 
    of the country lost the possibility to make a living. So, the question is 
    what kind of political invention is going to arise to take account of this 
    disaster that's unfolding in the world? It's really a disaster, and therefore 
    different kinds of political constructions are arising, you can see them on 
    the horizon. It's clearest in Latin America. But, the traditional leftist 
    way, the one that's represented with a great deal of hope by Lula in Brazil, 
    is probably too closely attached to the stagnant institutions of the industrial 
    age, and to the power system that put them into place, then partially destroyed 
    them. What needs to be discovered now are political and organizational forms 
    that give people the space and resources to take care of themselves, without 
    forgetting or denying their dependency on everyone else. So what I'm talking 
    about is not to immediately leap on a bandwagon of the social forums, or of 
    the Brazil-South Africa-India triangle, although these things are worthy of 
    our interest. I don't want to deny the tremendous amount of effort that's 
    going into constructing then, but there will need to be a further step, which 
    can only happen if you ask the question of who's really included. From this 
    viewpoint, if you've got your hands on a computer and a video camera, you 
    are included, you're part of the modern economy. But we are talking about 
    millions, even billions of people who increasingly don't have enough to eat. 
    There's the ultimate urgency, and my feeling is that a leftism for our time 
    will only come together when some network of social groups invents ways of 
    responding to it on the continental and global scales. In that perspective 
    the creation of transnational networks is very important, and the question 
    of solidarity is what kind of active role can people like ourselves have, 
    people who are included, but in a marginal way. A lot of people living in 
    the Western European countries are included in a marginal way, we're included 
    in what is called a "precarious" way, or an "unguaranteed" way. And it's interesting 
    that a lot of people have actually chosen this position. It's as if they said: 
    "I don't want to be included in the mainstream project of this predatory capitalism, 
    I prefer to be on the edges, in a marginal position." From that position, 
    on the edges of that insane kind of rivalry between the production blocs that 
    we were talking about before, it may be possible to look and listen enough 
    to find out what kind of political invention is actually going to happen. 
    I've begun to travel around the world for that reason, and you can see something 
    starting. You can participate in it. But as far as I can tell, nobody can 
    yet say exactly what it is.<br><br> </font> </div>

<br><br>
    The Westward expansion in the cultural sector started in the early 1990ies. 
    Poor misguided western curators started flocking to our shores right after 
    the Berlin Wall fell down. With their eyes wide open and minds full of pre-conceived 
    and book-based notions about the Socialist World, these darlings wanted to 
    find out something... At first we all thought they wanted to find out what 
    had actually happened to all of us after WW II and after 1989. As it turned 
    out, all they wanted was to find out what had actually happened to them, to 
    their utopian dreams after the reality, which they never knew first hand, 
    collapsed. The problem was and still is that this need has rarely, if ever, 
    been admitted in public. You see, in their view we had betrayed them by refusing 
    to function as "by proxy" evidence to the fact that a better and more just 
    society/world is possible at the current stage of human progress. Those darlings 
    never admitted in public that the collapse of real socialism and the socialist 
    utopia as we (not them) knew it during the better part of the 20th c. affected 
    them as much as it affected us. In private people like Frederic Jameson would 
    admit (during a course on Postmodern Philosophy in Dubrovnik, October 1990) 
    that "We, western leftist intellectuals, must face up to and develop the ethics 
    of failure"... In public, people like Catherine David would hint that (in 
    the Editorial Text of "Politics/Poetics. documenta X - the book", 1997) the 
    existence and the activities of the Eastern European dissident movements before 
    1989 was the reason for the destruction of the French Left movement in the 
    1970-1980ies. You see some French leftist intellectuals sided with the Party 
    Line in the Socialist countries while others - with the dissidents. That caused 
    a split in the movement and the Right walked in "on a white horse"... It makes 
    me wonder - whose life were/are we living anyway? <br>
    <br>
    What happened afterwards was that the evidential material for the failure 
    of real socialism was brought to the exhibition halls and the residency circuits 
    of Western Europe and the US for closer examination... I am talking about 
    artists and art works. Well, that's what they thought... In fact, this shift 
    was part of the westward expansion of Eastern European art scenes which, by 
    the way, was paid for by the taxpayer's money from Western Europe and the 
    US. Not bad tactics, wouldn't you say? In the situation where few people were 
    really interested to find out what actually happened or what the specific 
    characteristics of contemporary art in Eastern Europe are, we willingly started 
    to "sell the corpse of Communism" piece by piece. There was a market for that 
    until, I would say, 1995 at which point it became obvious that current reality 
    is much more interesting then the recent past... But that was for us, not 
    for them. They had cooled down and all they wanted to know about was the repressions, 
    not the social benefits of socialism, as confused and short-lived as these 
    might have been. In the face of the pressing concerns of transformation and 
    talk about NATO and EU membership, of changing societal patterns, construction 
    of market economy and parliamentary democracy, it seemed that our best chance 
    for sticking to who we are and yet building up a relevant contemporary agenda 
    was to maintain, in the words of an anecdote popular in Bulgaria at that time, 
    that "... we simply chose to take the hardest road to capitalism, via socialism... 
    but why the hell did we have to do that?" For "them" this was not interesting 
    enough. Capitalism, as a reality material to be investigated by artists, was/is 
    much better developed in the West so why would a curator deal with an Eastern 
    European artist to tell him/her about capitalism? Once again, they missed 
    the point for as survivors of utopia we were much better equipped to deal 
    with comparisons between socialism (the way we knew it) and capitalism (the 
    way we started to "build it up"). They never had this chance. They were naïve, 
    and in many ways still are, about "the best of both worlds"... The westward 
    expansion went on although this time it was carried through the efforts of 
    individual artists, there were no more mass interest and export. At this point, 
    1995, "their" interest shifted to the non-European and primarily Asian scenes... 
    Witness the first Gwangju Biennial in South Korea in September 1995 and the 
    immediately following Istanbul Biennial in Turkey in November 1995. Those 
    were two events that introduced artists from the Far East, as well as artists 
    from Muslim countries. The Istanbul Biennial from 1995 in particular, introduced 
    many female artists from Muslim countries although it featured many artists 
    from the Balkans as well. <br>
    <br>
    In the following years the westward expansion took different forms. On one 
    level, these were rather more equal and reciprocal for we were now "the wise 
    man" who hadn't much to say but have been through a lot (hence, conference 
    participations) and consequently could be invited to exhibitions on the basis 
    of "just art not exoticism". On the other hand though, it became visible that 
    differences are not as big as it seemed before - our colleagues in the West 
    were having as many difficulties making a living as artists as we did... Of 
    course, a part-time job in Switzerland would bring in significantly more income 
    then a part-time job in Sofia, Moscow or Prague, but still, most artists need 
    a part-time job to finance their project, right? The most enlightening moment 
    though was when we realized that thousands of artists all over the world survive 
    only because of residencies, state support in the form of stipends (see Holland 
    in the 1990ies) or purchases of art works (see the FRAC system in France), 
    and so on. The socialist system of support for the arts, as we had that before 
    1989, was flowed (due to its ideologically motivated background), yet it was 
    there and to our amazement we learned that the West does have a lot of practical 
    knowledge and experience in the field. The problem was that we were looking 
    for signs of the market realization in the works of our colleagues from the 
    West and in so many cases we couldn't find these... Very few of us managed 
    to get gallery representations in the West and to build up market presence... 
    Very few of our colleagues in the West managed the same thing. So, that was 
    something that was obviously not restricted to the Eastern European artists 
    alone...<br>
    <br>
    The second half of the 1990ies was marked by the advent of alternative strategies 
    and venues for expansion (infiltration, if you wish). That was the new media 
    context, the video festivals context, at the end, the illusion that there 
    might be something outside and beyond the market necessity. Once again this 
    field turned out to be the domain of East and West alike. It was an alternative 
    context to the power context of the real international art world. It did a 
    lot of good... It promoted a lot of artists and when it did not, still it 
    helped build up self-confidence and many networks that were the alternative. 
    Of course, this was also sponsored activity and the best actions of the alternative 
    network I was part of in the late 1990ies, the so called V_2 East Syndicate, 
    took place in the context of documenta X in 1997 (the Deep Europe workshop 
    in the Hybrid Workspace)... That is ironical, no? <br>
    <br>
    The great amount of activity in this context in the late 1990ies went along 
    with the most pressing developments in Europe - the final stages of disintegration 
    of Yugoslavia, that mini-empire of the East. Little by little a new disposition 
    of factors came to play. No longer Eastern Europe but the Balkans, although 
    the wars in ex-Yugoslavia were never really Balkan wars like they were in 
    the early 20th century. By that time we realized that the strategy of non-direct 
    expansion (they think they are "invading" us while we know we are tricking 
    them into letting us in...) had worked. A clear sign was that funding took 
    a different direction... Previously funding was directed mainly to events 
    taking place in the West. In the late 1990ies funding shifted direction and 
    there was quite a lot of money available for projects organized in points 
    east of the Austrian-Hungarian border... Why? Well, instead of creating opportunities 
    for artists from Eastern Europe to exhibit in the West and thus risk their 
    market success, which might lead to potentially damaging levels of emigration, 
    somebody figured it's much better to sponsor events in the places where the 
    artists in question actually live and work. This means - keep them occupied 
    and happy where they are. And we were/are... But the problem now is with the 
    EU expansion. It seems now that all that funding for art events in Western 
    Europe that included artists from Eastern Europe between 1989 and 2004 came 
    from "pre-accession" funds... The problem though is that the process of negotiations 
    is wrong. In the case of Bulgaria they started with four chapters. The number 
    one chapter that was closed (presumably all was OK from the point of view 
    of EU) was "Culture". In Bulgaria though the state policies for culture are 
    not only conservative without any attention paid to contemporary culture and 
    a lot of attention given to national cultural heritage (which is restricted 
    only to Christian heritage in a country that has a large Muslim minority, 
    among others). They simply do not exist... So, once again we must think of 
    expansionbut this time around we do not have to do anything because the EU 
    will come to us, not the other way around...<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, that argument may just be outdated. There was the 9.11 and, 
    as I was watching CNN live at the time of the hits, my first impulse was: 
    "Oh, I want to be American now..." The thing is that I have lived in the States 
    for nearly 5 years, on and off, and never before did I experience such an 
    urge... After 9.11, I thought, we are all - "the West"... They made us be 
    "the West"... And even Turkey, which is a Muslim country with Arab background 
    due to its Ottoman Empire heritage (state archives in the Ottoman Empire were 
    in Arabic, on the other side, Bulgaria was between 1396 and 1876 under Ottoman 
    domination), became part of "the West" after the bombings in Istanbul in December 
    2003. Now it doesn't really matter anymore if Bulgaria is or is not legally 
    within the EU and NATO... Psychologically - there is no difference; in terms 
    of economy - yes, in general; but wherever artists are concerned - no, and 
    that's unconditional because the market for art works is the same for all. 
    However, it might be a good idea for an artist to live near his/her gallery 
    in London, New York, Berlin or Paris no matter where he/she comes from - Sofia, 
    Dallas/Forth Worth, or Braunschweig... or Teheran for that matter. As part 
    of the so-called West I am very much interested to know about the Beirut, 
    Damascus, Jerusalem and so on art scenes. For me what matters is that contemporary 
    art is an urban and a cosmopolitan thing. So, I want to know more about artists, 
    curators and works in urban centers wherever they might happen to be located. 
    Because urban centers share some characteristics and it's up to us to find 
    out what do we have in common or in difference = cosmopolitan. The East/West 
    discourse is deeply outdated, as we knew it from the early 1990ies. I think 
    I have a better chance to be considered exotic if I insist on my Balkan identity... 
    after all there are a lot of Muslims in the Balkans... On second thought, 
    no, I do not want to be exotic anymore. I just want to "art". And please, 
    let's stop with that exchange stuff! The symbolic exchange went on for far 
    too long (we give you the corpse, you give us the money and the way out of 
    the EE ghetto), it is time to have some honest and fair market exchange - 
    you want Arab artists (?), or Balkan artists (?), or Eastern European artists 
    (?), well then, you are going to have to pay for your caprice... just as all 
    the time I have to pay with my life and works for the fact that I was not 
    born in Berlin or Stuttgart. <br>
    <br>
Why the hell doesn't anybody mention the fact that there are Swiss artists in an international show organized in Paris? Why the hell is it always mentioned when there are Arabic artists or Balkan artists or Eastern European artists included? What is a Swiss artist? By the way, I love the work of the Swiss artist Pippilotti Rist who lives in Los Angeles anyway.

    <label class="caption">Community Media Kit</label>
    <font class="text"> <br>Interview with Milos Vojtechovsky (CZ)
<br><br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: With the expansion of the European Union, significant geopolitical, economic and cultural shifts will happen. Ten countries from Central and Eastern  Europe will become 'equal' member states of the EU. What was the situation in the preceding 15 years in these countries like, concerning the development of media initiatives, and community media? Can you 'predict' how the media landscape might look in an expanding European Union?
</em></ul>
<strong>MV</strong>: The revival of awareness of the broader communities concerning media literacy, and involvement of non-professional journalists in mass media, following the fall of communist regimes underwent a complicated period during the last 15 years. It is therefore hard to outline the general situation, as development towards democracy is fragile, sometimes turbulent and unstable. Misunderstandings and misinterpretations are typical of many recent analyses and reveal wishful thinking on the one hand, or "dim prophecies" on the other. What is clear in the picture of the media landscape after '89 in Central and Eastern Europe is that it is inappropriate to generalize.Before the fall of communism, nearly in all of the countries in the region there were similar media legislative structures, policies and practices:censorship, broadcasting, purposes, etc. The difference was bigger according to local history in some countries like Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, and perhaps partly Romania. Nevertheless, the common ideological monopolies were maintained there almost as strictly as the Soviet model did.When the USSR started to dissolve, countries in the region evolved from the Soviet model at different rates, and in different directions. Many analyses have been written by media specialists from the West and US, and they are often biased by different optics applied from different political experiences. (One exception is for example the project Transition On Line [www.tol.cz], which focuses on monitoring freedom of media in Eastern Europe from a larger "comparative" perspective, and relies on the expertise of local correspondents and researchers.
<br><br>
The population in most of the former Eastern Block countries had a certain advantage to Western society in their ability to "read between the lines", decode the ideological propaganda, fence off mass media manipulation. Nevertheless, the active skills to communicate about public and political matters outside of the limited circles of dissent, the campagning media carriers like journals, radio broadcasters, posters, street actions, etc. became almost extinct. Dissent developed specific clandestine strategies to operate in the totalitarian state, and target the (limited) public. The latter was problematic to apply in the new "post-communist" situation. The key issue is the definition of what "community" actually is and if it is possible to apply in some kind of general "anthropological" term. The sense of community in trade unions, and other interest groups have been destroyed in many social layers. Periods of softer regulations were too short to generate community media awareness. The wide movement of "protest", "independent" or"community" media operating in Western Europe benefited from its relatively continuous history (since the '60´'s), and integrated to some extent within the general media structures. Media culture in former East European countries reflects local economical and political settings, where power is still concentrated and controlled according to interests of the government or commercial channels. The "voice" of the public domain is very weak and marginalized, even if some areas as environmental and humanitarian aid developed quite fast. Media always mirror society and one cannot expect democratic media in a pre-democratic state.
<br><br>
There are processes occurring on a pan-European scale: the role of the national state is diminishing, and multinational international press corporations - especially the audiovisual networks - will gain more control over local and regional areas. The originally structured media audience is changing into a species of consumers, and is categorized according to  their relationships to the market, financial stratification and cultural preferences. We are approaching interesting phenomena in the mediascape, similar to the emergence of the network of shopping malls, which divide the entire continent into interest zones from Portugal to Russia. The shelves of the media supermarkets offer the consumers what they are supposed to want, but the small local entrepreneurs and local market places are disappearing.
<br><br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: In an expanding EU, some other things are expanding as well: for example, censorship, and copyright and IP law enforcement that produce an atmosphere of strong political and economic control. Within this context, what would be the future of the public domain, cultural and information exchange in the EU, especially between those IN and those OUT?</em>
</ul>
<strong>MV</strong>: The actual situation of freedom of speech or civic rights in most of the post communist countries has considerably improved, compared to the centralized oppresive apparatus 15 years ago. But there is one new phenomena, which appeared during the transform towards market economy..It is important to realize the difference  between "political" control and "economical" control. Totalitarian systems attempt to standardize the spectrum of local jargons, to implement orthodox newspeach, eliminate autonomous public domains, lobotomize the sense for public constitution, and aim to establish passivity and loyalty of the people. Economical decision making within the public domain is a sublime art of control, could be functioning even more efficiently than strong censorship. Surveillance is just one  obvious tool from the whole spectrum: advertising industry, tendencies to turn people into consumers rather than creative users of technology,  neo-colonisation activities of bussines corporations which are influencing the educational systems and cloning the employees in to the one dimensional specialists. The tendency to strengthen the control apparatus, and eliminate and neutralize the movements of "civil disobedience" and "protest" against the ruling economic and political elites, is easy to  trace down both in the EU and outside the EU. Nevertheless, the crucial moment could be the necessity to balance the order, control, and economic consumer-friendly behaviour in the population. Restrictions on the functioning of the public domain, freedom of movement, working habits, etc. which could lead to market decrease, would oppose EU interests. Culture and information exchange is very much the result of the general settings of economical and political rules. If war would be the best strategy to inject new energy into the dwindling markets, then war would be considered an option. Ofcourse  somewhere else, outside of the "Empire". See for example the "War Against Terror".
<br><br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: Accession to the EU means the so-called "accessing states" have to comply and conform to a whole list of EU prescribed regulations. Joining means accepting, performing and perpetuating EU standards. Eventhough the EU maintains to promote cultural diversity and difference, the dangers for a homogenized, standardized mono-cultural Europe are lurking. What does complying with standards mean for issues of identity?
</em></ul>
<strong>MV</strong>: I don't believe in identity, in the sense of "national" behavioral patterns. To discharge such local patterns as alcohol and drug abuse, hunting, weapons idolatry, abuse of animals, gender suppresion, antisemitism, xenophoby, folkloristic propaganda, etc. would indicate that the EU nations are finally growing up after centuries of infantilism and ideological or religious phantasmagoria. To belong to Europe is still better than to suffer subordination under the today's corrupt local populist  regimes and policy makers.
<br><br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: Recently the document 'A EUROPEAN MANIFESTO has been circulating, in order to support, and underline the importance of 'minority community media'. In a way it deals with minority community media, and the way social inclusion policies are implemented, 'ensuring freedom of speech, the right to receive information and the right to communicate for all, including the right for minorities to receive media in their own language'. This is all regarded as basic human rights for all citizens. What do you think of these kind of documents?Is it just 'paper' or can it have a real impact on promoting minority media?
</em></ul>
<strong>MV</strong>: Culturally and democratically oriented media have always been a minority in their scope, and will remain so. Any document which attempts to formulate the need to sustain, revitalize, and reframe the "normal" languages and discourse is a challenge, and provides the minority with the feeling of identity. Their survival and evolvement depends on many aspects and issues.
<br><br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: Regarding freedom of speech and the public domain - especially in our information society - do you think that Information and Communication Technologies play a crucial  role towards realizing the aforementioned human right? Often, Internet  and new technologies are positioned as values by themselves, as well as tools which will help to overcome the 'digital divide'. Is there a realistic platform to realize this, or are we talking about monopolies in that field, lack of infrastructure in countries in the periphery, etc?</em>
</ul>
<strong>MV</strong>: The process of implementing new technologies (mostly developed in a military context) on a broader scale, always creates profound shifts in society. Parts of the impact one can control, others create "gates without locks". Internet, and electronic networks in general, bring about an enormous change in people's actions, thoughts and behaviour. The feedback between techno zone and old social patterns is a very complicated system.The elite benefits from the advanced information technology, and scientific research is still only a small fraction of the world's population. Enourmous quantity of world population lacks not only rights to communicate, or access to ICT, but even rights access  the basic human resources, like water, food, health care.. Nevertheless, the technocracy want to keep to control our futures.To which extent this small rich elite will be willing to consider to share the profit with the poor members of the family without access to technology, and how long they can manage to keep this control is a question for futurologists.The recent United Nations World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) held in December 2003 offers a good example. The Summit outcomes were limited after an arduous and expensive process. However, according  Anriette Esterhuysen, APC executive director, "from the perspective of many civil society organisations that participated actively, the WSIS has created a new opportunity for solidarity across ideological, sectoral and geographical divides".
<br><br><br>
<ul><em><strong>Q</strong>: In concept for the FM@dia project [http://www.fmedia.ecn.cz/], you mention creating a functioning platform for better collaboration among media activists, artists, free radios,Internet publishers, etc. In other words, this is about a process of networking. There are certain theories which propagate the view that the "network model" ceased to be the emerging contemporary organizational model. The claim is that It lost its subversive character, and became a static model, that yet, didn't reach levels of decision making. What is your opinion on this? Do you think that this form of collaboration/networking is the future for independent media movements? Or not?
</em></ul>
<strong>MV</strong>: Definitely there are chances to find common strategies and shared interests amongst a variety of individuals, initiatives and communities which have been geographically, ethnically, nationally or class divided in the pre-electronic age, including cultural initiatives, military and para military units, business corporations, etc. We hope to be able to involve, meet and get acquainted with initiatives, which are seeking dialogue, discussion and mutual communication in general, not necessarily via strategy of "networking". Networking is not the overall focus of the Forum as you suggest. It is needless to say that community media and networking are influenced by financial support, and are partly dependant on bureaucratic interests and structures or activists interests and visions. But the fact that many individuals from wide range of places and languages are exploring possibilities to express their views via the "institution" of "community" is the proof that the process is growing from the inside.
<br><br>
A recent study by Mark Surman and Katherine Reilly commissioned by the Social Science Research Council says that "This issue of appropriation - using networked technologies strategically, politically, creatively - is amongst the most pressing that civil society faces in the information society. The big question is: what should we do with these networked technologies now that we have access to them? ... By all accounts, the broad majority of civil society organizations are struggling with the issue of how to mold these tools to meet their needs - to increase the impact of campaigns, projects and programs using networked technologies. Or, in many cases, they are simply using them without any thought about where and how these technologies fit into the political work for which they feel so much passion. It is not that these organizations use networked technologies completely without question or critique, but rather that they don't take the time to consider how they can be using these technologies most strategically." (Surman and Reilly, Appropriating the Internet for Social Change, SSRC, November 2003)
<br><br>
Anybody who is working from inside the communication apparatus is facing the seduction to perceive the problems from a "technical" perspective as a "software" solution. "New media activism", and for example some wings of the anti-globalist movement are often leading to the feeling of self-sufficient prophecy, singular interest defence, messianism and neglecting towards"ordinary people". The chance to cultivate the community with appropriate use of media, and achieve a growing impact means to abandone elitarist or "avant-gardist" attitudes of the Artist. It means to approach (and understand) a broader public with an old and best tool for networking:"solidarity". There will be no cultivation, rejuvenation and evolvement of community media without a continuous fertilized platform ready to accept hybrid forms; a platform which allows to look and reach beyond the borders.

  <div align="left"><label class="caption">Stephen Kovats (CA/NL)</label> <br><br>
          <font class="text"> Canadian architect and media researcher Stephen Kovats spent a decade upon German unification designing and establishing media art and culture related programs at the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation. His Studio Electronic Media Interpretation studio hosted numerous international projects, symposia and exhibitions exploring the relationships between media space, political culture and electronic art. In 2000 he published MEDIA · REVOLUTION which wrapped up the "Ostranenie International Electronic Media Forum" series focussing on the role played by media art and culture upon the societal transformation process in Central and Eastern Europe. During this period he founded several media culture oriented exchange and network programs including ArCHI-ToNOMY, EMARE, ECX and the current Bauhauskolleg, a multidisciplinary post graduate program for alternative urban design. Thereafter, based in New York, he developed work and communications based strategies for mobile media and urban reconstruction projects including the initiation of a new urban Masterplan for the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Currently Kovats is programs developer at V2_Institute for the Unstable Media in Rotterdam.<br>
